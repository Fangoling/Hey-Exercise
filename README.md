# Intro Course Project App of Fangxing Liu for the iPraktikum

To pass the intro course, you need to create your own unique iOS app (based on SwiftUI).

There are no requirements regarding the functions of your app, so you can get creative.
However, we provide you with Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) that your app needs to fulfill.

After each day of learning new Swift and SwiftUI concepts, these NFRs may change, or new NFRs get added.

## Submission procedure

You get a **personal repository** on Gitlab to work on your app.

Once you implemented a new feature into your app, you need to create a Merge Request (MR - Sometimes we will also reference these as "Pull Requests"(PR)) to merge your changes from the feature branch into your main branch.

Your tutor will review your changes and either request changes or approves the MR.

If your MR got approved, you also need to merge it!

### Deadline: **15.10.2024 23:59**

Until the deadline all of your PRs **need to be merged** and your final app **needs to fulfill** all of the requested NFRs!

## Problem Statement (max. 500 words)

As a student it is really hard to keep up a healthy fitness routine, especially being consistent. Without a reminder I often just stop doing my routine and don't have motivation to start again.

To overcome this challenge, I need an iOS application that can help me keep track of my workouts. First of all the app should allow me to add new workouts, specify the weekdays and store a description of the workout. Second of all,it would be nice to able to add exercises and the according current performance metric (repition, weight, etc.).

Additionally, I would like it if I could see get an overview over past performances to see my personal progress.

Moreover, the app should provide me with notification in a way of a motivational text to remind me of upcoming training sessions. This would help me keep a motivation and routine for my fitness journey.

In summary, as a student who is trying to maintain a healthy and balanced life, I need an iOS app that helps me keep track of my fitness routine, remind me of workouts and give me insights into my past progress. With such an app, I would be able to make better decisions in maintaining a better routine, and ultimately achieve a healthier life.
